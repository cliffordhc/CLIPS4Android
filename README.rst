CLIPS4Android
==============

*CLIPS4Android* is a project created to adapt `CLIPS <http://clipsrules.sourceforge.net/>`_ to Android (I know, too obvious).


The project is organized as follows:

ClipsAndroid
  It is an Android library which is intended to be used by other Android applications. To compile the eclipse project, it is necessary to compile CLIPS for Android first (see `Compiling CLIPS for Android`_.).

Examples
  It contains different Android applications which use *ClipsAndroid*:
  
  * `Simple demo <http://github.com/gomezgoiri/CLIPS4Android/tree/master/examples/SimpleDemo>`_ performs basic operations
  * `Animal demo <https://github.com/gomezgoiri/CLIPS4Android/tree/master/examples/AnimalDemo>`_ is an expert system to identify animals
  * `Semantic reasoning demo <https://github.com/gomezgoiri/CLIPS4Android/tree/master/examples/SemanticReasoningClipsDemo>`_ infers new semantic content (RDF triples)


Compiling CLIPS for Android
---------------------------

Follow the following steps to compile CLIPS for Android:

 1. Install the `NDK <http://developer.android.com/tools/sdk/ndk/index.html>`_
 2. Go to the *jni* folder
 3. Run *ndk-build* [*]_

 .. [*] Providing you have added it to your *PATH*.


 
Debugging CLIPS on Android
--------------------------

The cleanest way to show messages from a native library in Android is by simply redirecting its output (see `Redirecting stdout`_).
However, this method has not always work for me (sorry, I don't know the cause).
That's why I forced CLIPS to show all its messages using Logcat (see `Logcat from native code`_).


Redirecting stdout
******************

CLIPS may throw *system exits*.
As a result, the Android process using CLIPS can unexpectedly crash without giving any useful information.
To show CLIPS' original error messages, redirect NDK's standard output to *LogCat* using the following commands:

.. code-block:: bash

  $ adb shell stop
  $ adb shell setprop log.redirect-stdio true
  $ adb shell start


Logcat from native code
***********************

Sometimes the previous property does not work (I don't know why yet).
Since `messages can be directly logged on Logcat <http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10274920/how-to-get-printf-messgaes-written-in-ndk-application/10275209#10275209>`_, 
we replaced the printf's with these *Logcat*'s logs in the `issue 2 <https://github.com/gomezgoiri/CLIPSonAndroid/issues/2>`_ .

To that end, we have done an `utility macro <https://github.com/gomezgoiri/CLIPSonAndroid/blob/master/ClipsAndroid/jni/clips/logcat.h>`_.
Common usage:

.. code-block:: c
  
  #include "logcat.h"
  
  ...
  
  aprintf("This is an standard message\n");
